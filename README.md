# simpleParticleSimulator

## Getting Started
1. Download the files from the simpleParticleSimulator folder
2. HeapTester.java includes a unit test for the heap implementation using JUNIT JUPITER, which is included in the /lib folder.
3. Compile the file ParticleSimulator.java with the following command:
   
   _javac ParticleSimulator.java_
   
5. Run the particle simulator using the following command:

   _java ParticleSimulator particlesInitial.txt_
   
7. It is imperative to run ParticleSimulator.java with the argument particlesInitial.txt because this text file contains information regarding the time duration of the simulation, the particles' starting position, and the particles' initial x-velocities and y-velocities.

## Images
1. The particlesInitial.txt file should contain the particles' starting position and velocity information.

2. When run, a new window with the particle simulation should open.

3. If run with the txt file particlesInitial.txt, the particles at the end of the simulation should form a turkey.
